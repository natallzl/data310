**Modify the existing filter and if needed the associated weight in order to apply your new filters to the image 3 times. Plot each result, upload them to your response, and describe how each filter transformed the existing image as it convolved through the original array and reduced the object size.**


**What are you functionally accomplishing as you apply the filter to your original array?**


**Why is the application of a convolving filter to an image useful for computer vision?**


**Stretch goal: instead of using the misc.ascent() image from scipy, can you apply three filters and weights to your own selected image? Again describe the results.**


**Apply a 2x2 filter to one of your convolved images, and plot the result.**


**In effect what have you accomplished by applying this filter?**


**Does there seem to be a logic (i.e. maximizing, averaging or minimizing values?) associated with the pooling filter provided in the example exercise (convolutions & pooling)?**


**Did the resulting image increase in size or decrease? Why would this method be useful?** 


**Stretch goal: again, instead of using misc.ascent(), apply the pooling filter to one of your transformed images.**
