## Final Project Idea Brainstorming

**General topic:** Honey bees! 

Project ideas:

- the effect of pesticides on honey bees & honey production
- image identification of bees carrying pollen vs not carrying pollen

**Research question:** Can a machine learning model be created that can accurately classify whether a bee is carrying pollen or not? 

**Data description:**

A honey bee image dataset based on data used in the publication [*Recognition of pollen-bearing bees from Video using Convolutional Neural Network*](https://doi.org/10.1109/WACV.2018.00041) by Ivan Rodriguez, Rémi Mégret, Edgar Acuña, José Agosto, and Tugrul Giray. The images are from videos recorded at the Bee facility of the Gurabo Agricultural Experimental Station of the University of Puerto Rico in 2017.

- 714 image files of bees carrying/not carrying pollen
- A corresponding .csv file 
  - 714 rows and 3 columns (index number, filename, pollen carrying classification)
  - pollen carrying classification: 0 or 1, discrete variable
- Data source: ["Honey Bee pollen," Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ivanfel/honey-bee-pollen)

Other potential dataset: [Honeybees and Neonic Pesticides](https://www.kaggle.com/kevinzmith/honey-with-neonic-pesticide)
