### Data wrangling and analysis

**For next time: Import the households dataset for your selected country and create a data frame with a variable that describes each of the following.**

- household ID

- unit

- weights

- location

- size

- gender

- age

- education

- wealth

**Pivot the persons columns within your households data to a long format in order to produce a similarly specified dataset that describes all persons residing within all households.**

**Using this data frame describing all persons standardize, normalize and percentize your variables and visualize each post transformed dataset as a heatmap that illustrates the heterogeneity of the combination of patterns.**
